PySAP-fmri
===========


Python Sparse data Analysis Package fMRI plugin.

NB: even if this is (historically) a PySAP plugin, it is installable independently and does not require any installation of PySAP to work.

Dependencies includes however:

- numpy / scipy
- numba : For fast JIT compilation of TV methods.
- ModOpt : For the implementation of optimisation algorithms.
- tqdm: for progress bars
- joblib: For parallel reconstructions and wavelet decomposition.
- PyWavelet: For wavelet transforms.
